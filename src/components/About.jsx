        <p>Hi there! I'm Mary, a product designer based in <b>Charlotte, NC.</b> My path to product design has been anything but linear—I started  with a passion for art and spent a few years creating digital illustrations before diving into the world of coding. Now, I’m completing a <b>Master’s in UX Design</b> at MICA. Along the way, I’ve been driven by a <b>curious mind</b> and a love for <b>continuous growth and learning</b>, and I’ve learned a lot about how to<b> work with stakeholders</b> and leverage <b>design principles to create satisfaction.</b></p>

          <h2>Skills</h2>
          
          <p >What I Bring to the Table:
            <ul>
              <li><b>Wireframing & Prototyping:</b> Low-fi, hi-fi, functional prototypes. They’re all in my toolkit and I know when to leverage each of these tools.Creating everything from quick sketches to detailed, fully interactive prototypes.</li>
              <li><b>Design Systems:</b> In all of my work, I prioritize creating design systems that are flexible, cohesive, and capable of supporting a dynamic and varied product. Organization is key for a successful product team; I’m skilled with using Figma’s wide range of advanced tools such as components, variables, auto-layout, styles, and everything in between.</li>
              <li><b>UX Research & Usability Testing:</b> Designing and conducting user interviews/usability testing, and analyzing data to uncover actionable insights.
              </li>
              <li><b>Interaction Design:</b> Mapping out intuitive user flows, microinteractions, and delightful animations to enhance usability and increase engagement.</li>
              <li><b>Creative Problem-Solving:</b> Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. This ensures your creative energy goes toward the best outcome for the user.</li>
              <li><b>Technical and Software Skills:</b> Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), responsive design, animation, accessibility, SEO.</li>
              <li><b>Creative Problem-Solving:</b> Tackling complex challenges by balancing user needs, business objectives, and technical constraints.</li>
              <li><b>Collaboration & Communication:</b>  From my experiences in digital art and ecommerce, as well as my Master’s program, I’ve worked closely on cross-functional teams, and internal/external stakeholders to bring ideas to life.</li>
              <li><b>Continuous Learning:</b> I’m always experimenting with new tools, design trends, and methodologies to stay sharp and innovative. I lean into feedback and want to bring my best every day.</li>
